## Weather App
this app uses the OpenWeather API in order to retrieve the weather for different cities around the world. It uses simple JavaScript to interact with the api.

## Use
To use - enter the name of the city you'd like to know the weather of. (note- we have to click on the search icon with our mouse~ this was a practice project, so I shall fix it!)
